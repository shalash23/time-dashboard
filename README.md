## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GSAP



### What I learned

Event delegation. Using advanced DOM techniques which actually reduced the amount of code that I needed to write. Should've gone with React in this case but decided not to at the end. Yet it works just fine.


### Continued development

Learning GSAP more. Was very interesting to use this library.

### Useful resources
